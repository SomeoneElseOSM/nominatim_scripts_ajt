# nominatim_scripts_ajt
Manages the running of Nominatim with a modified input file.

The transform scripts in here are designed to create an admin hierarchy
based on not on the "who collects my bins" rule, but on a "sense of place".
"ntransform_03.lua" attempts to use English traditional counties for this.
